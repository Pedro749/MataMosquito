A little game made in a course, using JavaScript

## how it works?

the game mechanics are based on capturing the height and width of the browser window, and creating flies at random positions based on those measurements.

## what's the goal?


The objective of the game is to continue killing flies during the proposed period of time, without letting any escape, thus not losing hearts and winning.
